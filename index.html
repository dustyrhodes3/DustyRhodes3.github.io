	      <li>Took over 100% outsourced iOS / back-end project, hired locally moving design, development, QA, and ops in-house over the course of 30 days cutting costs in half while increasing velocity.</li>
	      <li>PMs added to agile process, design brought into a pre-production phase with developers so features can be designed with low dev time and quality.</li>
	      <li>One week sprints instituted to keep everyone in touch with where development is at along with TestFlight versions of the app which can be demoed in pitches or shared to investors through a beta TestFlight group.</li>
        <li>Instituted version control using git and code reviews in order to keep everyone on the same page, end of day merges used to keep master moving forward.</li>
        <li>Dockerized all legacy apps and Microservices to prevent discrepancies between dev environments and production deploys.</li>
	      <li>Moved from monolithic node REST & Socket apps to golang / node Microservices resulting in faster iterations and features.</li>
        <li>Instituted feature flags and shadow releases in order to keep master constantly deployed in the wild preventing merge conflicts and other slows downs but still having the ability to run A/B tests or test features on a small subset of users.</li>
	      <li>Further brought down AWS costs 60% by scaling EC2 and RDS instances down to the correct size and instituted autoscaling rules to handle spikes in traffic.</li>
        <li>Moved to ECS w/ Spot Instances to bring cost down further (EC2 90% in some cases) and create a continuous deployment environment making the feedback loop from dev -> PM / non-technical stakeholders faster.</li>
        <li>Created graphite dashboard and utilized StatsD in order to internally track app usage such as logins, forgot password, picking players etc. resulting in better uptime as we could see trends in app failure.</li>
        <li>Utilized collectd to track machine health as well as SNS to monitoring app health and react as necessary.</li>
